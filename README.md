# Snake-Game
Snake Game on 8051 Microcontroller Kit
This project implements the classic Snake Game on an 8051 microcontroller kit (AT89C52) using an 8x8 LED matrix, 74HC595 shift register, and a 4x4 keypad for user input.

Features
LED Matrix Display (8x8): Displays the snake, food, and game status.

4x4 Keypad Input: Allows the player to control the snake's movement.

74HC595 Shift Register: Expands I/O ports for efficient LED matrix control.

Timer0 and Timer2: Used for LED scanning and game timing.

Written in C (Keil C): Developed and compiled in Keil uVision IDE for 8051.

Hardware Requirements
AT89C52 (or any 8051-compatible microcontroller)

8x8 LED Matrix

74HC595 Shift Register

4x4 Keypad
